## Comments on Klo'e Yim Chew Ng's Citibike Analysis

The formula set up for the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis is correct but there are some tweaks that 
could be made that would help the analysis.

The Question asks "Do males cycle longer distance as compared to females?" But the hypotheses test trip 
duration, which is measured in a unit of time not distance. This proxy could create problems as maybe males 
have longer bike rides but take more breaks or go slower than women so their distance covered is less.
This potential problem could be solved by either gathering trip distance data, which may be arduous to 
collect, or, more simply, restating the Question as "Do males cycle for longer durations compared to females?"

Another potential problem could arise from how the null and alternative hypotheses are stated. They do not
mention a time frame from which the data is collected. For example, a change would be to state the null 
hypothesis as: "The cycling trip duration for females on average is the same or longer as compared to males
in the month of January in 2016". Without stating the time frame, some could argue the month the data was 
collected from could influence the trip durations for the genders and maybe the average trip durations for
each gender would change during summer months.

An appropriate statistical test would be a t-test, as you could assume the distribution of trip durations for 
both genders are normal and also that the two groups are independent of each other.
