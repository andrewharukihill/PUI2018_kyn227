### Assignment One
1. Generated 100 samples of different sizes with N> 10 & N>1000, with 5 different distributions.
2. Distributions used were: Normal (Gaussian), Poisson, Binomial, Chi-squared, LogNormal
3. Extra Credit: Fitted a Gaussian to the distribution of mean (LogNormal) graph

### Assignment Two

1. Downloaded the Citibike data provided and chose an interesting hypothesis to formulate.
2. Question formulated: Do men cycle longer distances compared to women? Null hypothesis was set up as: 
   H0 - The cycling trip duration for females on average is the same or longer as compared to males.

### Assignment Three
1. Completed assignment 3 using Z-test to understand if the implementation of an alternative bus route for bus line X8 improves circulation.
2. Z-score reflected a 2.56 which was more than 0.05 thus rejecting the null hypothesis. 

All three assignments were done and discussed collaboratively with Rachel, Qinyu and Vaidehi in group discussions.
