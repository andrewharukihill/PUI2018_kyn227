#### Assignment 1 - Lab 3
1. Created a file called test.csv in the CSV (Comma-separated values) format
2. Commited file to repo with the screenshot uploaded 
3. Pulled the file onto my local terminal to make changes
4. Typed the commands [git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch HW2_kyn227/Lab3_kyn227/test.csv' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all] to remove the file. NB: Take note of the spaces whenever required, or not. 
5. File was successfully removed from both local and github. No traces of history of the file found.
